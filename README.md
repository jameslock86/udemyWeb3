# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```



For NFT class:
Cold start dev server:
1. Delete contents of /config.js.
2. Start a node using $ npx hardhat node.
3. run a deployment using $ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost.
4. Go into /config.js and add single quotes around hex keys.
4. Run dev server using $ npm run dev. (edited)
